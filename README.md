## 🧭 One-Time Setup (First-Time Only)

### 🧱 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
- git clone https://github.com/Sahana-Pixel/learnloop.git

📁 2. Move Into the Project Folder
- cd learnloop

Your folder structure should now look like:

learnloop/
├── frontend/
└── backend/   ← Work here!

🔄 Daily Workflow (For Both Developers)
Before pushing every time, always pull the latest code:

- git pull origin main

✅ After adding your files, commit and push:

- cd learnloop         # Make sure you're at root!
- git add .
- git commit -m "Your commit message"
- git push



⚠️ Important Tips
🔁 Always push from the root project folder (learnloop/)

🚫 Never push from just inside frontend/ or backend/ folders
