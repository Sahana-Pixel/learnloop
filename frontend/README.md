🧭 One-Time Setup (First-Time Only)
🧱 1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and run:

git clone https://github.com/Sahana-Pixel/learnloop.git
📁 2. Move Into the Project Folder
cd learnloop
🛠️ Setting Up the Backend (For Your Friend)
🗂️ 3. Create a Backend Folder
Inside the root project directory, run:

mkdir backend
Your folder structure will now look like:

learnloop/
├── frontend/
└── backend/   ← Work here!
🧑‍💻 4. Start Backend Development
Work inside the backend/ folder using your preferred tech stack (e.g., Node.js, Express, etc.).

✅ After adding your files, commit and push:

cd learnloop         # Make sure you're at root!
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
🔄 Daily Workflow (Both Developers)
Before pushing every time, pull the latest changes:

git pull origin main
✅ This keeps your code up-to-date and avoids overwriting your teammate’s work.

⚠️ Important Tips
Always push from the root (learnloop/) directory — not directly from frontend/ or backend/.
