# 🚀 LearnLoop Collaboration Guide

A clear and simple step-by-step guide to help you and your friend collaborate smoothly on the **LearnLoop** project — with both frontend and backend in one repo.

## 🧭 One-Time Setup (First-Time Only)

### 🧱 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sahana-Pixel/learnloop.git
📁 2. Move Into the Project Folder

cd learnloop

Your folder structure should now look like:

learnloop/
├── frontend/
└── backend/   ← Work here!

✅ After adding your files, commit and push:

cd learnloop         # Make sure you're at root!
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push

🔄 Daily Workflow (For Both Developers)
Before pushing every time, always pull the latest code:

git pull origin main


✅ This keeps your code up-to-date and avoids overwriting your teammate’s work.

⚠️ Important Tips
🔁 Always push from the root project folder (learnloop/)

🚫 Never push from just inside frontend/ or backend/ folders

✅ Follow this flow to avoid merge conflicts and keep teamwork smooth
