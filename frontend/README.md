🧭 One-Time Setup (First-Time Only)
🧱 1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and run:

git clone https://github.com/Sahana-Pixel/learnloop.git

📁 2. Move Into the Project Folder
cd learnloop

🛠️ Setting Up the Backend (For Your Friend)
🗂️ 3. Create a Backend Folder
Inside the root project directory:
mkdir backend

📁 Your folder structure will now look like:
learnloop/
├── frontend/
└── backend/  ← Work here!

🧑‍💻 4. Start Backend Development
Work inside the backend/ folder using your preferred tech stack (Node.js, Express, etc.).

✅ After adding files:
cd learnloop      # Make sure you're at root!
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push

🔄 Daily Workflow (Both Developers)
Before pushing every time, make sure to pull the latest changes:
git pull origin main

✅ This syncs your code with the latest changes from your teammate and avoids conflicts.

⚠️ Important Tips
Always push from the root (learnloop/) directory — not from frontend/ or backend/ directly.
